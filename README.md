# XOR Encryption and Decryption Tool

Hello everyone!  
This repository is a C language program that I designed to enable easy and secure encryption and decryption of files using the XOR encryption algorithm. One of its distinctive features is its ability to store the keys generated during encryption in an SQLite3 database. This provides the flexibility to decrypt files at any time using the securely stored associated keys.
