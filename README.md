# XOR Encryption and Decryption Tool

Hello everyone!  
This repository is a C language program that I designed to enable easy and secure encryption and decryption of files using the XOR encryption algorithm. One of its distinctive features is its ability to store the keys generated during encryption in an SQLite3 database. This provides the flexibility to decrypt files at any time using the securely stored associated keys.

## Requirements

Before running Cryptor-X, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **GCC Compiler:**
   - If you are on Windows, you can use [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) to install the GCC compiler.
   - On Linux, you can use your package manager to install the GCC compiler.

2. **SQLite3:**
   - Ensure that the SQLite3 library is installed on your system. You can download it from the official [SQLite website](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) or install it using your system's package manager.

3. **WindowsAPI for GUI (optional):**
   - If you plan to use the GUI features on Windows, make sure to have the WindowsAPI library downloaded and configured. You can find more information on how to set up the WindowsAPI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/apiindex/windows-api-list).

These requirements are essential for compiling and running the program successfully. Make sure to check the documentation for any additional platform-specific instructions or dependencies.

## Features

- **Robust XOR Encryption:** Utilizes a strong XOR encryption for file security.
- **SQLite3 Storage:** Stores generated keys in an SQLite3 database.
- **Anytime Decryption:** Allows file decryption using keys stored in the database.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and user-friendly interface for easy usage managed by Windows API (only alvailable on Windows).

## Usage

1. **Download the Project:**
   - Download the Cryptor-X project from the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/ttmassa/file-encryption).

2. **Navigate to the Build Folder:**
   - After downloading, navigate to the build folder within the project directory. This is where the compiled executable and related files are located.

   ```bash
   cd ./path/to/project/build

3. **Execute the Main Executable:**
   - Find the `encryption_manager.exe` file in the build folder.
   - Execute the `encryption_manager.exe` file to launch. 
   Note that you might need executive rights to run the file, depending on your system's security settings.

   ```bash
   ./encryption_manager.exe

4. **File Storage:**
   - The files generated by the program during encryption or decryption processes will be stored in the same build folder. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read and write to this location.

Now you're ready to start encrypting and decrypting files!
